\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%In queueing theory,
%a re-entrant line,
%or \gls{reqn} is a queueing network where tasks can be processed by servers
%in a fixed order.
%In particular,
%the tasks can be processed by the same servers more than once.
%Each server has several buffers.
%Tasks arrive at the buffers in a predetermined order \needc.
%This is similar to \glspl{mcqn},
%in which each server has multiple buffers for processing different classes of
%tasks.
%However, the \gls{reqn} model only contains a single job class \needc.
%
%The scheduling of \gls{reqn} and \gls{mcqn} systems can be modeled and solved
%as optimization problems.
%We look at finite time horizon scheduling problems.
%We can naively model these problems as discrete tasks arriving with an arrival
%process A and a service process S.
%However,
%the resulting optimization problem is too large to solve \needc.
%In order to overcome this issue,
%we can approximate the system as a fluid flow problem,
%where the stochastic processes are replaced with \tbd{}
%under certain \tbd{} conditions.
%We can then solve the fluid flow problem using \gls{sclp} \needc,
%and apply the solution back to the original discrete network.
%
%It is often the case that the data required for optimization is known with a
%degree of uncertainty.
%In particular,
%the exogenous arrival rate and the service rate of tasks may be known only
%approximately.
%This uncertainty in these rates can arise from several sources \needc:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item they may be difficult to measured exactly,
%    \item they may change slightly over time,
%    \item there may be changes,
%    \item it may not be possible to assign decision variables with
%        the precision of the solution,
%        causing inaccuracies to accumulate.
%\end{itemize}
%
%There are different strategies for dealing with uncertainty in
%optimization problems.
%\Gls{so} is one such strategy.
%The main idea of \gls{so} is to treat the data as random variables.
%In our case,
%this would mean the arrival rates and service rates would be treated as
%random variables.
%Usually,
%assumptions are made about the family or the distribution of these variables,
%and part of the optimization algorithm involves obtaining estimates for them.
%\Gls{so} tries to find the most likely optimal solution \needc.
%\Gls{ro} is another strategy for solving optimization problems with uncertainty
%in the data.
%In general,
%\gls{ro} uses a more conservative decision procedure than \gls{so}.
%The solution obtained,
%known as the robust solution,
%is a worst-case solution.
%This means that it is the best solution that is feasible in for all possible
%values of the data,
%where possible means within the values allowed \needc.
%The set of allowed values for the data is called the \textbf{uncertainty set}.
%
%Recently,
%there has been work on \acrlong{ro} of \gls{sclp} problems,
%in particular for \gls{mcqn}.
%The current state of the art can solve \gls{sclp} for constant data.
%However,
%there is still a lot of outstanding work.

Many applications today need to run as a collection of cooperating services
running on a set of computer servers.
The reasons for this are many and varied.
There are applications which require more computing power than is available on
a single computer,
and the most economical way to run it is to distribute the workload across
multiple machines.
Deep neural networks are an example,
where training is conducted on many computers in parallel.
In other cases,
different functions in a complex system, or system of systems may run on
heterogeneous computing devices.

\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}


\subsection{\acrshort{mcqn}}
\label{subsec:theory:mcqn}

Let $\qnet$ be a queueing network containing $i = 1, \ldots, I$
servers operating over a finite time interval $[0,T]$.
The servers process fluid which is divided into classes $j = 1, \ldots, J$,
and fluid from class $j$ processed by one server $s(j) = i$.
Fluid waits for processing in buffers $k = 1, \ldots, K$,
and,
once processed,
flows from buffer $f(j) = k$.
An conceptual example of fluid or task flows can be seen in \Cref{fig:task-flows}.
Tasks entering $\qnet$ from the outside are called exogenous,
and tasks of class $j$ arrive at one of the servers with a rate $a_j$.
We use this constant rate to approximate the Poisson arrival process
with parameter $a_j$.

For fluid of class $j$,
we apply a control to server $s(j)$ at time $t$
to process fluid at rate $u_j(t)$ per unit time,
giving us a vector of control variables $u(t) \in \RR{J}$.
Also at time $t$,
the amount of fluid awaiting processing in the $k$ buffers is $x_(t)$.

The specification of the basic \gls{mcqn} problem is:
\begin{align} \label{eq:mcqn}%
    % looks like 3 columns but is 6 as & makes a right-aligned
    % and left-aligned pair so we have 6 columns but only use the
    % left, right, and left from the 3 pairs
    && \max\limits_{u(t), x(t)} &&& \int\limits_0^T(\gamma^\top +
      (T-t)c^\top)u(t)+d^\top x(t)\mathrm{d}t \nonumber \\
    & \mbox{MCQN} & \mbox{s.t} &&& \int\limits_0^T G u(s)\mathrm{d}s +
      F x(t) = \alpha+at, \\
%      x(t)   \leq \alpha+at, \\
    &&&&& H u(t) \leq b, \nonumber \\
    &&&&& x(t), u(t) \geq 0, ~ 0 \leq t \leq T, \nonumber
\end{align}


$\gamma \in \RR{J}$ is processing cost per job class,
$c$ is \tbd.
$d \in \RR{K}$ is the holding cost per buffer,
$\alpha \in \RR{K}$ is the initial amount of fluid in the buffers
$b \in \RR{I}$ is the maximum processing rate of the $J$ servers.
Additionally,
we have the matrices $G \in \RR{J \times K}$ and $H \in \RR{I \times J}$.
$G$ describes the inflows $(1)$ and outflows ($p_{j,k}$).
$F$ describes which buffers belong to which server,
while $H$ describes the service times $\tau_j$ for each job class,
the reciprocals of the maximum service rates $\mu_j$.

\begin{align}
    G = G_{j,k} = &
    \begin{cases}
        1 & f(j) = k \\
        -p_{j,k} & f(j) \neq k
    \end{cases} \\
    H = H_{i,j} = &
\begin{cases}
    1/\mu_j & s(j) = i \\
    0 & s(j) \neq i
\end{cases}
\end{align}

% Workload Placement Example
%=============================================================================
\subsection{Workload Placement Example}
\label{subseq:theory:workload-placement}

Suppose we have a computerized workload that we would like to run on a set of $I$ networked servers.
The workload we wish to run is made up of several software tasks,
divided into $J$ classes.
We assume that tasks of class $j$ arrive according to
a homogeneous Poisson process with parameter $a_j$.
Each server can process any class of task,
but is limited to $R_i$ RAM and can process at a maximum of $P_i$ operation per unit time.

Tasks in class $j$ require $r_j$ RAM and have a time to live,
which is distributed exponentially with parameter $\tau_j$.
Equivalently, the tasks' service rate has a Poisson distribution with parameter $\mu_j = 1/\tau_j$.
There are $K = I \times J$ buffers for tasks of class $J$ in server $I$.

The number of tasks of class $j$ waiting in the buffer on server $i$ at time $t$ is $x_{i,j}(t)$,
with initial value $x_{i,j}(0)$.
The cpu usage of tasks of class $j$ on server $i$ at time $t$ is $u_{i,j}(t)$.
For each task of class $j$, $y_{i,j}(t)$ indicates whether it is running on server $i$ at time $t$.

We derive the following math model for the workload placement problem:

\begin{align}%
    % looks like 3 columns but is 6 as & makes a right-aligned
    % and left-aligned pair so we have 6 columns but only use the
    % left, right, and left from the 3 pairs
    && \min\limits_{u} &&& \sum\limits_i \sum\limits_j
    \int\limits_0^T x_{i,j}(t) \mathrm{d}t \nonumber \\
    && \mbox{s.t} &&&
    \sum\limits_i x_{i,j}(t) = \sum\limits_i x_{i,j}(0) + a_j t -
    \sum\limits_i {\mu_j}  \int\limits_0^t u_{i,j}(s) \textrm{d}s
    \label{eq:workload-placement} \\
    &&&&& \sum\limits_j y_{i,j}(t) r_j + \sum\limits_j u_{i,j}(t) r^\prime_j \leq R_i, \nonumber \\
    &&&&& \sum\limits_j u_{i,j}(t) \leq P_i, \nonumber \\
    &&&&& u(t), x(t) \geq 0, ~ 0 \leq t \leq T. \nonumber
\end{align}%

The model of \Cref{eq:workload-placement} is not directly computable with \gls{sclp}.
We translate \Cref{eq:workload-placement} to the form of \Cref{eq:mcqn},
which will enable us to use an implementation of \gls{sclp} to solve it.

First,
we compute the matrix $H$ which has dimensions $I \times K$
and is used for the CPU and RAM constraints.
$H$ has $I$ rows,
one for each server,
and has a $1$ repeated $J$ times,
in position for that server and $0$ elsewhere.
For example,
the first $J$ entries of the first row have value $1$ followed by $0$'s,
while the second row begins with $J$ $0$'s,
followed by $J$ $1$'s,
and continuing with $0$'s till the end.

Next, we compute $F$ which has $J$ rows,
one for each class,
and $K-J$ columns.
$F$ relate the buffers to the servers.
The pattern for $F$ is to have the row $j$ of the form:
$(0 \ldots 1 \dots 0)$,
with the $1$ in the $j^{\text{th}}$ position repeated $I-1$ times,
for a total of $J(I-1)=K-J$ columns.
The reason why $F$ has only $K-J$ columns and not $K$,
is to convert the buffer constraints to inequalities because our current implementation does not support equality constraints at this time.

Next, we compute $G$,
which represents the task flows between buffers.
The matrix $G$ has dimension $J \times K$,
and the entry $G_{j,k}$ has value $0$ except when $k mod J == j$.
In this case $G_{j,k} = -\mu_x$, where $x= \lceil{k/j}\rceil$.

% Questions
%=============================================================================
\section{Questions}
\label{sec:questions}

We would like to known the bounds of the arrival and service rates.
If there is historical data,
what is the state of the art on these estimates?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How can we estimate the parameters and the uncertainty set with and
    without historical data?
    How can we compute the robust counterpart of \gls{sclp} from this?
    How can we create a policy for parameter estimation that doesn't lose too
    much in terms of the objective?
    It may be possible to estimate the data by running a system which is far
    from optimal.
    In many cases this could be expensive.
    \item Can we develop a system and method to generate policies from online
    networks that can detect changes in the data and self-adjust?
    \item Can we extend \gls{sclp} to piecewise constant parameters,
    in particular the task arrival rates?
    \item What other ways can we extend the arrival process?
    \item How can we estimate the uncertainty set for the robust problem?
\end{enumerate}
